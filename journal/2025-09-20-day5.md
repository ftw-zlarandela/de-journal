# Journal — 2025-09-13 — EXAMPLE DAY

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Talk through your pipeline (i.e. Ingest to raw, move into clean, move into mart)
- 1. Sandbox, 2. DLT Script, 3. dbt Script
- Focus on the pipeline, instead of the analysis
- e.g. for Music Business: End-to-End Workflow includes Catalog Management, Customer Engagement, Sales Transactions, Business Insights
- 1NF: Atomicity, no repeating group; 2NF: No partial dependencies; 3NF: No transitive dependencies

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- Unit test - test within machine
- System test - test within server
- Schema (in terms of data) - aggregation of relational tables
- .yml = Yet another Markup Language
- Atomicity - at the lowest level, no group or lists, a "grain"

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Explore the data
- Always document, and make a copy before modifying

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- For the sample exercise, I used simply joins as the data is still limited enough for me not to think so much on the join to use, etc. 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- When to create Views vs Table
- The DLT and dbt setup for local and remote, like when to do and what to do from scratch, but not really an urgent question

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- Meet with group
- Finish assignment
- Study/read Shi's guide on using datasets from other sources besides Clickhouse
- Read further on Terminal

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- https://www.kaggle.com/
- https://clickhouse.com/

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
What surprised me? What would I do differently next time? What will I watch out for in production?

Because of the lesson last week, today went a lot smoother in terms of setting up the remote database. Although the process for normalization and producing the database was already discussed in the DataCamp, I found it much easier to understand through Sir Myk's teaching and the live example. I was kind of surprised with how I was able to complete the one exercise, and I hope that I'll be able to further improve my skills and understanding of SQL and the practical applications.  For the assignment, I'll definitely try to start the process from the top just to make sure that I understood what was discussed.


### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
