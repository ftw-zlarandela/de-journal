# Journal — 2025-09-13 — EXAMPLE DAY

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Talk through your pipeline (i.e. Ingest to raw, move into clean, move into mart)
- 1. Sandbox, 2. DLT Script, 3. dbt Script
- Focus on the pipeline, instead of the analysis
- e.g. for Music Business: End-to-End Workflow includes Catalog Management, Customer Engagement, Sales Transactions, Business Insights
- 1NF: Atomicity, no repeating group; 2NF: No partial dependencies; 3NF: No transitive dependencies

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- Unit test - test within machine
- System test - test within server
- Schema (in terms of data) - aggregation of relational tables
- .yml = Yet another Markup Language
- Atomicity - at the lowest level, no group or lists, a "grain"

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Explore the data
- Document, and make a copy

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- For the sample exercise, I used simply joins as the data is still limited enough for me not to think so much on the join to use, etc.
- 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- When to create Views vs Table
- The DLT and dbt setup for local and remote, like when to do and what to do from scratch, but not really an urgent question

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- Meet with group
- Finish assignment
- Study/read Shi's guide on using datasets from other sources besides Clickhouse
- Read further on Terminal

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
-

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
What surprised me? What would I do differently next time? What will I watch out for in production?




### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
