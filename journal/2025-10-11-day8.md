# Journal — 2025-10-11 — DAY 8

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Data in the Wild: Data Collection
- Data is a representation of the real world
- Data Lifecycle: Data Generation (Reality) → Measurement/A number (Representation) → Data Cleaning & Transormation (Processing) → Answering Business Question (Action)
- Data as Different Shapes: Tabular, Hierarchical, Graph, Time Series, Geospatial
- Build things to last 

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **Pandas** - used to read and write small-scale file formats
- **Ibis** — used to connect to databases, based on Python
- **Interface** - general tools other users maybe able to use even without knowing exactly how it works
- **API** - Application Programming Interface

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Document everything!

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- For our assignment, instead of typecasting the days_since_prior_order as Integer, we kept it as string for the 'nan' value since there was no apt alternative we could think of for the variable.

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- How to adapt the code for web scraping other dynamic sites (will work on this)

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] Finish journal
- [ ] Finish Data Camp assignment
- [ ] Complete other in-between Data Camp courses
- [ ] Practice end-to-end data ingestion, cleaning, and modelling

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/instacart-online-grocery-basket-analysis-dataset

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
What surprised me? What would I do differently next time? What will I watch out for in production?

I was really happy with today's lesson since we were able to tackle web scraping at our last day. I thought myself proficient with presenting most of the time, but with the past few weeks, I find it lacking so I need to work on that too, especially since we'll be presenting our capstone. I also was a lead for the first time, this week, and I realize that there are still areas where I can improve on as teamwork and coordination is especially essential to working regardless of the field.

### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
