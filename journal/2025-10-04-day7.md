# Journal — 2025-10-04 — DAY 7

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- DEs do not delete or edit raw tables.
- But they can create new columns and new tables, and make sure to prioritize numbers/IDs for the back-end.
- When creating an end-to-end pipeline, duplicate the subfolders, **not** create from scratch!!
- Important to know the trade-offs because the DE makes the trade-off.
- Business questions: make money, save money, compliance
- Quality <> just accuracy: Accuracy, Completeness, Reading, Relevancy, Timeliness
- Trust = accuracy * transparency * timeliness
- Checking of values should be conducted more than once, for the architecture, may be best during Transform (Clean) and Mart. Every time you move the data is more accurate.
- OULAD Dataset
    * Volume/Completeness: row counts table per course/day 
    * Nulls/Requiredness: critical dimensions populated 
    * Referential inegrity: id_assessment exists in assignments 
- Maturity Model
    * Level 1: SQL checks + simple alerts 
    * Leve2: Config runner + log table
    * Level 3 : dbt tests & orchestration + lineage
    * Level 4: Full observability platoform
- Always best practice to data type cast.
- Fact table: representation of core process.
- What to ALSO put on Dashboards: "Updated as of" tile, Data health card: % tests passed, freshness nulls, Clear footnotes: filters, definitions
- Data is a shared responsibility.
- Types of tests: Range test, category test, data type test
- What to Track in Dashboard: 
    * % Tests passed (by dataset, by rule type) 
    * Freshness lag (minutes/hours)
    * Volume vs baseline (Z-score or Interquartile Range)
    * Null % on critical fields
- Dashboard: SQL vs dbt

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **Procurement** - when you buy something, e.g. materials, equipment
- **KYC** - Know your customer
-  **DQ Contract** - business process where an agreement is created with the business for what they require, the thresholds, the SLA or turnaround time, and the owner. including "Warn vs Fail" policy, and quaratntine bad partitions
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** - contract that outlines the level of service a provider must meet
- **RACI** - Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed
- **Data Owner** - the role with decision-making power
- **Data Steward** - executioner of Data Owner
- **MTTD** - Mean Time To Detect
- **MTTR** - Mean Time To Result
- **Lineage** - relatively new concept, the history of the data

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Document everything.

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- For the assignment, our group used a Snowflake Schema instead of a Star to accomodate for future addition in the categories.

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- When actually is it best to use which schema, but the general concensus is that it depends also on the previous team, the existing data, and the front-end user or client.

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] Meet with new group
- [ ] Finish DQ assignment
- [ ] Finish new assignment
- [ ] Practice end-to-end data pipeline

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- Range Check Example
    INSERT INTO dq_check_results SELECT 101, 'studentAssessment', 'score_range'

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
What surprised me? What would I do differently next time? What will I watch out for in production?

In hindsight, a data quality dashboard is very effective for vouching for the data you use for analytics, but I didn't think of its potential existence before it was mentioned. Since I'm still kind of lost on the end-to-end process due to my freelance work last week, that will be my main goal for the next week besides the assignment. In terms of production and presentation, I can see that my group has mostly taken into account the general cleaning process. I want to be able to work independently but collaboration with my groupmates really enforces in me the importance of having a good working relationship with a group, as well as setting up a time to meetup and be on the same page with each other.

### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
