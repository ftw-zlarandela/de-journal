- DEs do not delete or edit raw tables.
- But they can create new columns and new tables, and make sure to prioritize numbers/IDs for the back-end.

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- 
- 

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- 

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- For an example exercise, I did X, because of Y

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
